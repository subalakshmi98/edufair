      <p class="page-about-text"> Rural children in developing countries face many problems in getting to and staying in
        school. In addition to well-known social and economic factors, distance-related obstacles to schooling are very important
        but surprisingly disregarded in the available literature.

This paper analyzes the present situation in rural Brazil and specially in the state of São Paulo, where a large rural school
transport system has been operated since the 1960s. The analysis considers mainly policy issues as a guide to the provision of rural pupil transport. The analysis considers also the advantages and limitations of different strategies for improving the access to schools in rural areas of developing countries. An example of pupil transport coupled to rural school consolidation is provided. Finally, a preliminary framework for the definition of a specific public policy is proposed.
The relationship of distance and schooling is particularly critical in rural areas, where children must walk
long distances to widely dispersed schools and must
travel additional distances to nearby urban areas for
higher primary grades. With the lack of public transportation and an inability to pay for private transportation, most rural children abandon the school system
after relatively few years. This distance-related problem
concerns the analysis of accessibility - both time and
physical accessibility - (Moseley et al., 1977), as well
as the issues of welfare and equity in the access to
public services. The access to school is an important
part of accessibility to essential activities, which have to
be considered as a right in contemporary life. If
convenient transport means are available to support
this right, the measured results reflect the degree of
‘transport-related welfare’, while the opposite reflects a
condition of ‘transport-induced deprivation’ (Nutley,
1984, p 358). Hence, transport infrastructure and transport means play a vital role in attaining the basic needs
of the rural population.

Safety in pupil transport is of paramount relevance. It
is related to several feaures of the transport system,
mainly the driver capability and vehicle and road
conditions. In the case of specialized services, bus
drivers are key elements of the system, both operationally and socially. They are normally chosen in the local
market and have natural linkages to local people,
which helps to foster responsible behavior. Nevertheless, most school drivers do not receive adequate
training and sometimes drive unsafely. School bus
drivers in the state of SCo Paulo must meet special
qualifications: a minimum age of 21, possession of a
professional driver’s licence, and have received special
training. The present vehicles can be considered
adequate with the exception of the ‘kombi’, which is
not well equipped to transport children. In Sgo Paulo,
vehicles have to have special devices like a speedometer and external safety signs and lights and have to
pass through physical evaluations twice a year.
However, deficient enforcement allows unskilled or
ill-prepared drivers to keep working in remote areas,
where it is also common to see dilapidated vehicles.
With respect to roads, travel on gravel roads occurs at
low speeds and accidents used to be rare events.
Nevertheless, when paved roads are used, vehicles
travel at more dangerous speeds and the existence of
intersections require careful planning: the use of such
roads in SLo Paula has led to fatal accidents.
